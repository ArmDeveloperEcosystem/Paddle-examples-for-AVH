* ImagetNet is an image database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy (currently only the nouns), in which each node of the hierarchy is depicted by hundreds and thousands of images. The project has been instrumental in advancing computer vision and deep learning research. The data is available for free to researchers for non-commercial use. Please refer to [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/index.php) for more features. You can use relevant dataset after accepting their [Terms of access](https://image-net.org/download).
